<h1>COC155 week 03 practical session - Camera access and local storage</h1>
<p>In this session we will play with the getUserMedia API to capture video stream and still image from the built-in camera and save retrieve data locally with the
simple local storage API. 
As getUserMedia and local storage APIs work on both desktop and mobile browsers, you can complete the exercises on desktop and be assured that it will also work on mobile 
devices. But in the future remember to check compatibility of any API you intend to use before proceeding with further implementation. </p>
<p>You can make changes in the "playground" div at the beginning of this page, and go through the following exercises by completing the JavaScript functions to:</p>
<ol>
<li>get live video stream from built-in camera;</li>
<li>display the live video stream on the webpage;</li>
<li>get a snapshot when required;</li>
<li>save the image in local storage with some annotation and get them out after reloading the page;</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 1: getting live video stream from your built-in camera</h2>
<p>
getUserMedia API provides the live video stream for you. You just need to call it and tell it what you want is video.
To make sure you've done it correctly, display some feedback in the callback function when the video stream is got back successfully
as well as when there is an error.
</p>
<p>
You can call getUserMedia API in the following way:
</p>
<code>
 navigator.getUserMedia(constraint, successCallback, errorCallback);<br>
</code>

<p>You can refer to the lecture slides for the format of constraint argument and the callback functions.</p>
<p><i>Doesn't work? did you give the correct constraint to the API function? Have you defined successCallback function? Have you
dealt with the various vendor prefixes?</i></p>


<h2>Step 2: displaying the live video</h2>
<p>
We got the live video, but if we can't use it in some way, e.g. play it, it would be useless. Let's play the video directly on the page.
To do so you need a HTML5 video element in autoplay mode.
</p>
<code>
	&lt;video autoplay>&lt;/video>
</code>
<p>
The video element is already added for you in the "playground" div. But you need to link the video element with the live video stream, similar to a img element
the video displayed in a video element is decided by its 'src' attribute. In the success callback function you defined, associate the live video stream
with the src attribute of the video element.
</p>
<p><i>Doesn't work? The src attribute expects a URL not a stream. You can create an ObjectURL from the
       stream to represent it. There's a useful interface for doing just that at window.URL.createObjectURL</i></p>


<h2>Step 3: getting a snapshot</h2>
<p>
The ultimate goal of your user may be taking a photo, so let's enable them to grab a snapshot from the video when the "take snapshot" button
is clicked, just like what the digital camera software are doing.
</p>
<p>
This can be a bit tricky if you are not farmiliar with the HTML canvas element, but basically all you need to do is to get hold of the 2D context of the 
canvas element, and draw an image from the current video image using one of the canvas context's membership functions called drawImage(src,offset-x,offset-y):
</p>
<code>
	var mycontext = mycanvas.getContext("2d");<br>
	mycontext.drawImage(myvideo,0,0);
</code>
<p>Note that mycanvas and myvideo are just dummy names, you need to get hold of the appropriate element first by yourself. Now
do your own snapshot function. The canvas element is already added in the playground div:</p>
<code>
	&lt;canvas>&lt;/canvas>
</code>


<h2>Step 4: saving the snapshot and some annotation in local storage</h2>
<p>
Now let's persist the image as well as some annotation from the user in local storage so that we can revisit them later on.
</p>
<p>
The local storage API allows you to push and retreive simple key value pairs:
</p>
<code>
		 localStorage.setItem(key,value); <br>
		 localStorage.getItem(key);<br>
</code>
<p>Now the question is, we know how to persist strings with those functions, but what about image. Well, you probably need to convert the image into
a string before putting it into the local storage. It turns out that the canvas element has handy function called toDataURL that will convert its current drawing
into a base64 string representation.</p>
<p>So now convert the image on the canvas to a base64 string representation using: </p>
<code>
		 mycanvas.toDataURL(image_type);<br>
</code>
<p>Note that mycanvas and image_type are dummy names you need to get hold of the canvas element yourself and also shoose the a image type for your conversion.</p>

<p>After that, simply save the image into local storage with a key of your choice, and with the string converted from the canvas drawing as the value. Then use
the Chrome development tool --> resource tab to check whether you have it in the local storage. You may want to take what the user has
entered in the annotation input field and save that in the local storage, too.</p>


<h2>Step 5: retrieve the image and annotation</h2>
<p>Now the final step is to retrieve them. You can set the base64 string representation as the src of a img element directly, and it shouldn't be too difficult for you
to set the annotation string retrieved as the content of a paragraph.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hopefully if you have gone through all the exercises you should now have a good idea of how camera access works and what you can do with the video you get, as well as
how the basic local storage APIs work.</p>
